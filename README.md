# CommandLineFPS
A Dot Net Core adaption of the Command Line FPS tutorial by OneLineCoder (https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/CommandLineFPS)

It started off as a curious experiment to see what it would be like to get it to work on .NET Core.
I was very happy when I got to the point where I saw my maze being rendered, but the framerate was quite low
in comparison to the C++ version. I thought that maybe it is because I'm not working directly with the
underlying Console handle to write to the Console buffer (ignorance is bliss ðŸ˜‰).
After some time I managed to figure out how to use the underlying Console Handle from .NET's Console so that
I could write to the Console directly. This gave a significant improvement to my rendering however, I noticed
that my wall characters were messed up. After many hours of googling the Win32API functions for interacting
with the Console and inspecting the .NET Core source code I almost gave up trying to figure out what I was doing wrong
since the .NET Core Console was using the Win32API calls underneath and was working.
Then it finally dawned upon me that perhaps there is a marshalling concern that is happening between .NET Core and
the Win32API. I used the current Encoder on the Console to get the byte version of my character array and BOOM it worked!
Except that I got the almost exact frame rate than the original effort I put in using the normal .NET Core Console ðŸ˜”.
Also, there is a bit of a flicker happening as well.

This was an interesting experiment and something I quite enjoyed persuing, especially to take my mind off my normal programming
routing. I felt almost like I was a university or high school student again. So big thanks to OneLineCoder for the idea!
Maybe I might tinker on it some more but I can't promise anything.
